# Flipper Zero Animations
A collection of my custom Flipper Zero background animations

I've included both the finished (compiled) animations, as well as their source (raw) files for further modification. Only the compiled versions will actually work on the flipper. 

To add an animation to your flipper:
* Download the animation you want (NOT ending with `_RAW`)
* Connect your flipper to your PC
* Open qFlipper
* Within the file manager, navigate to `SD Card/dolphin`
* Drag/upload the folder of the animation you want into your Flipper
* Download the manifest.txt from your Flipper
* Copy the corresponding block from the manifest.txt into yours
  * For example, copy the following to add the funky_skeleton animation
  ```
  Name: funky_skeleton
  Min butthurt: 0
  Max butthurt: 14
  Min level: 1
  Max level: 3
  Weight: 3
  ```
* Reupload edited manifest.txt into your Flipper
* Restart your flipper (left + back) 

Animations created following [Talking Sasquach's Flipper Zero Animation Process](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vR_nZRakD6iwJVQS8Pf4y7Wm4klcucrC7EKVO8m_DQV63To7e-alqD0yaoO3sTygjcChfcRo80Hdeet/pub)

Check through this doc for more details on what the `weight` and other such values mean.

Happy flipping!
