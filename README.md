# Flipper Zero Animations
A collection of my custom Flipper Zero background animations

I've included both the finished (compiled) animations, as well as their source (raw) files. Only the compiled versions will actually work on the flipper. 

To add an animation to your flipper:
* Download the animation you want from  the `raw` folder
* Connect your flipper to your PC
* Open qFlipper
* File Manager -> SD Card -> dolphin
* Drag/upload the folder of the animation you want into your Flipper
* Download the manifest.txt from your Flipper
* Copy the corresponding block from my manifest.txt into yours
  * For example, copy the following to add the funky_skeleton animation
  ```
  Name: funky_skeleton
  Min butthurt: 0
  Max butthurt: 14
  Min level: 1
  Max level: 3
  Weight: 3
  ```
* Reupload edited manifest.txt into your Flipper
* Restart your flipper (left + back) 

Animations created following [Talking Sasquach's Flipper Zero Animation Process](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vR_nZRakD6iwJVQS8Pf4y7Wm4klcucrC7EKVO8m_DQV63To7e-alqD0yaoO3sTygjcChfcRo80Hdeet/pub)

Check through this doc for more details on what the `weight` and other such values mean.

Happy flipping!
